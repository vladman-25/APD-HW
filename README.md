* C map-reduce algorithm using Pthreads and synchronization methods such as mutex and barrier for counting the number of perfect power numbers. Works for multiple input files with varying sizes in which threads optimally take files to process (in order to equally split work) and then mappers take the solutions and combine them and give the result. 
* Java Replicated Workers model to equally split tasks of file reading and processing.
* C MPI distributed programming application to process an array using Ring algorithm on normal topology or broken link.
